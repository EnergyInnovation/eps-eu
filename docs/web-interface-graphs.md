title:  "Output Graphs Available in the Web Interface"
---

The web interface allows the user to visualize Energy Policy Simulator (EPS) results through a variety of output graphs.  By default, there are 80 different output graphs available in the web interface (starting with model version 1.4.0), though how many and which graphs are shown may be customized for different EPS country or regional adaptations.  Many of these 80 graphs include more than one data series, such as a graph of power plant capacity by plant type (coal, nuclear, hydro, etc.).  Therefore, several hundred different data series are available through the web interface.  (Thousands more are available in the downloadable version of the EPS.)

Here is a list of the graphs that are standard for the EPS web interface as of version 1.4.1:
